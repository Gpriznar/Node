Projects designed to practice and expand upon backend programming knowledge.

**Todo:** My first forray into backend development. This website is a simple application designed to test my connection with a local server and ability to retrive and display jsons. 

**Trip App** This project takes user input and displays it in a list format. (You will need to copy an image address in order to successfully load the image field) Each submission is able to be deleted by utilizing a GUID key. 

  -Updates to Trip App: Added ability to have unique user registration and login. Users trips will are now saved relative to their login information and will be called on the Add Trip page.

**Movies** This movie application focused on using routers to connect various pages together on a local server in order to simplify code and allow for additional manipluation. The user can add movies, navigate to a different page using a "partial" menu and then view information about their movies or delete from the list. This app took advantage of the uuid package rather than manually creating a key via a function. Furture updates would include the ability to sort by genre.
